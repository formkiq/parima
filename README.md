# Launch Your Website using AWS in Minutes 
## â€¦ and leave any server and infrastructure complications behind



## What is Parima?

Parima is a free, open source project that has been created to allow easy publishing of static web sites and JavaScript web applications (like Angular or React apps) using Amazon Web Services. It's ideal for designers and front-end developers who want to launch a new web site without having to worry about hosting outside of creating an AWS Account.

Parima creates a simple, serverless architecture for your web site, using Amazon S3 to store the markup, code, and asset files, and AWS CloudFront to distribute the site using HTTPS. It can be installed with or without a custom domain (for custom domain requires domain DNS to be using Route53).

## Requirements

* **An Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account:** Parima requires you to have your own Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Cloud. AWS provides a generous [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) that includes all of the products used by Parima (aside from adding an optional custom domain in Route 53).

    It is a good idea to have an [AWS Budget](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/budgets) with an alert set up before using AWS, to prevent any unexpected costs. (For personal and/or low-traffic sites, you should be able to keep costs well below $5 a month, so you could use that for the budget amount unless you expect an unusually large amount of traffic.)

    **[Sign Up for an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)**

* **[AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)** is a tool provided by AWS to manage your AWS services. Using the AWS CLI, make it easy to deploy Parima and to sync your local website with AWS.



# How It Works

<img src="images/aws.png" alt="AWS Services">

Parima installs into your AWS Account using CloudFormation (through the Console or AWS CLI).

CloudFormation sets up an S3 bucket to hold the artifacts of the website, as well as CloudFront to host the website in Amazon's content delivery network (CDN). Optionally, if a Domain/Hosted Zone is specified, a Certificate and Route 53 DNS entries are created for your custom domain.


    
# Installation

**NOTE:** It may take up to **15 minutes** for the CloudFormation script to complete.

## CloudFormation Parameters

### WebsiteVersion
Parima is set up to handle multiple versions of a website and easily switch between them. This CloudFormation parameter control which version of the website is active. By default a **v1** version is created. This means that you need to upload all your website contents to the **v1** directory inside of S3. 

Creating a **v2** version of your website is very easy. Upload your website contents to a **v2** directory and then run the CloudFormation script and specify **v2** in the **WebsiteVersion** parameter. This will tell CloudFront to serve files in the **v2** directory. If you want to switch baack to **v1**, just run the CloudFormation again and specify **v1** as the **WebsiteVersion**. Running CloudFormation to update will not overwrite any of your existing files.

### HostedZone & DomainName (Optional)
By default, CloudFront generates a random URL to access your website, such as https://*abcdefg99*.cloudfront.net.

You can specify a custom domain/Route 53 hosted zone during the installation of Parima, and that domain will be used for the website, e.g. www.mycompany.com.

**Note:** The domain needs to have a Route 53 Hosted Zone. e.g. Route 53 Hosted Zone mycompany.com must exist and the DNS must point to the Amazon Web Services' DNS.

A domain registered outside of AWS can be used (by setting up an Amazon Route 53 [Hosted Zone](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones#) and supplying the Nameserver entries that will be generated by Route 53 to your Domain Registrar), or a new domain can be registered within the AWS Management Console.

**[Register a Domain using Amazon Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home#DomainRegistration:)** | **[Transfer a Domain to Amazon Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home#DomainTransfer:)**

## CloudFormation Outputs

The Parima CloudFormation generates the following outputs:
* WebsiteUrl - The Website URL
* AccessKeyId / AccessKeySecret - IAM Security credentials
* SyncCommand - The aws cli command that can be used to sync the website in the current directory with AWS
* S3Bucket - The location of the hosted website files

## Using AWS CLI 
Assumes you have the AWS CLI [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

* **Clone Repo:** git clone https://github.com/formkiq/parima.git
* **Run Installation With Custom Domain:** aws cloudformation deploy --template-file parima.yml --stack-name &lt;stack_name&gt; --parameter-overrides HostedZone=&lt;hosted_zone_name&gt; DomainName=&lt;domain_name&gt; --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM  --region &lt;aws_region&gt;
* **Run Installation Without Custom Domain:** aws cloudformation deploy --template-file parima.yml --stack-name &lt;stack_name&gt; --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --region &lt;aws_region&gt;
* **CloudFormation Results:** aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name &lt;stack_name&gt; --region &lt;aws_region&gt;

The CloudFormation output will display:
* The StackStatus will indicate if the CloudFormation template was successful or not.
* The CloudFront URL used to access the website.
* The AccessKey/Secret that have read/write access to update the website.
* The aws cli "sync" command that can be used to sync the current directory to the s3 bucket.
